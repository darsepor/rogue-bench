A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom (Corrected for this version)

1. Introduction
Your goal is to find the Amulet of Yendor and return from the Dungeons of Doom. You will explore, fight monsters, and collect treasure. This version of Rogue has its own specific command set. Refer to this guide carefully.

2. On-screen Information
- The bottom status line shows your Level, Gold, Health Points (Hp), Strength (Str), Armor (Arm), and Experience (Exp).
- The top line is for messages.
- The main screen is a map of what you've seen. `@` is you, `A-Z` are monsters.

3. Commands
Commands are single characters. Some can be prefixed with a number to repeat them (e.g., "10s" to search 10 times).

--- Movement ---
- h, j, k, l: Move left, down, up, right (one space).
